# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 7: Neural Networks

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 7: Neural Networks**, where we dive into one of the most important areas in machine learning. In this tutorial, we explore both **shallow** and **deep** neural networks using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow's Keras API**. You’ll learn how to build, train, and evaluate neural network models for classification tasks using the **MLPClassifier** in Scikit-learn and more advanced architectures with **tensorflow.keras**.

## Introduction
In this part of the tutorial series, we focus on neural networks, covering both shallow models and deep learning architectures:
- **MLPClassifier**: Using Scikit-learn’s **MLPClassifier** to create and train simple feedforward neural networks for classification tasks.
- **tensorflow.keras**: Introduction to building deeper networks with the **Keras API** in TensorFlow, including how to define models, compile them, and train on large datasets.
  
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of both shallow and deep neural networks and how to implement them for various classification tasks.
